Interview task about designing a 'vending machine' which takes in a set of commands specified in index.php as an array. Parses them though the controller, and prints out status notifications. Input parameters include currency/products+costs/steps that a prospective user might do to 'buy' an item.

Conditions are that its written in pure PHP with no database or framework. Input parameters are set in index.php and results are printed on page (in Bulgarian).
First iteration done in 6 hrs.

Steps to run: 
- docker-compose up
- navigate to localhost
- tweak project commands in index.php if you feel like messing around with its execution
